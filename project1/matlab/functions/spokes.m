spokes.m returns a "spokes filter" matrix that can be used to simulate
measuring spokes of a cartesian image.

INPUTS:
    ny (int): number of rows in image
    nx (int): number of columns in image
    nspokes (int): number of spokes on the bike wheel
    theta (float): angle (rad) to initiate first spoke at (default=0)
OUTPUT:
    spokes (ny Ã— nx double): sparse matrix with ones along the lines formed
    by the spokes
%}
